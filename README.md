Vim A Real Big Game For Coder
----------------------------

It seems that the "vim" could turns out to be a big game with endless adventures and tasks 
for us, rather than a simple text editor. But the "vim" is in essence a simple text editor.
The first time you enter the game, "vim" is a innocent role, the last time you leave the 
game, "vim" becomes a blazeding one, leaving both hateful and lovely but precious experiences
for you. Though there are many other fairly good editors like emacs, UEStudio, EditPlus,
EmEditor, EverEditor, and so on, brings you enjoyment for some periods, the "vim" should be
the last and ever editor for you. For the sake of old hard times, for the sake of working on 
servers for servering public, for the sake of contribution and aspiration. "vim" is the King
of editor, and the King Arthur in coder's Rounds.
