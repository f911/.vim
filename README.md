# Vim A Real Big Game For Coder

    It seems that the "vim" could turns out to be a big game with endless adventures or tasks 
for us. Rather than a simple text editor, the "vim" is in essence a simple text editor.

    The first time you enter the game, "vim" plays an innocent role, the last time you leave 
the game, "vim" becomes a blazeding one, leaving both hateful and joyful precious experiences
for you. Though there are many other fairly good editors like emacs, UEStudio, EditPlus,
EmEditor, EverEditor, and so on, they brings you with quite enjoyment for some periods, the 
"vim" should be the last and ever editor for you. For the sake of old hard times, for the sake
of working on servers for servering public, for the sake of contribution and aspiration. 
"vim" is the King of editors, and the King Arthur in coder's Rounds.
